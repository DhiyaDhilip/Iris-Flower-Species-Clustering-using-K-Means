# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
Developed an unsupervised machine learning pipeline using K-Means clustering to segment data into meaningful groups. Performed full EDA, feature scaling, elbow method, and silhouette evaluation. Saved the best model and deployed a Streamlit app for real-time clustering predictions.
